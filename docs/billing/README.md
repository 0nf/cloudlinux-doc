# Billing


Imunify360 pricing depends on the registered users on the installed server:

For cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin hosting panels it calculates the number of users in it, excluding system users.

For standalone installation, it calculates users with UID equal or more than 500 in CentOS 6 and UID equal or more than 1000 in CentOS 7.

The pricing model of Imunify360 includes 4 types of server licenses which are billed monthly per one server license:

_Single user_ - good for servers with only one user in the system.
_Up to 30 users_ -  good for servers with users quantity less than 30 or equal.
_Up to 250 users_ - good for servers with users quantity less than 250 or equal.
_Unlimited_ - good for servers with users quantity more than 250.
